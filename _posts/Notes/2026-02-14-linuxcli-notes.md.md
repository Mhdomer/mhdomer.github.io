Linux systems provide a reliable and robust alternative to closed-source systems, such as MS Windows Server and UNIX. Moreover, choosing Linux can help cut down licensing costs dramatically. If you are not convinced, compare the cost of hosting a web server using Debian 11 with the cost of hosting a web server using MS Windows Server 2022. When we compare the combined costs of licensing and the minimum required hardware for each of these modern releases, we will have a strong case for Linux. Of course, we cannot claim that Linux is always the best choice; however, Linux is the best choice for many scenarios. Before using this option, we must focus on securing our Linux systems, also known as Linux _hardening_.
